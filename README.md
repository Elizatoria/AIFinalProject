# Summary
<p>This project explores the impact of varying convolutional neural network (CNN) hyperparameters on the classification accuracy of the Fashion MNIST dataset. By experimenting with different filter sizes and batch sizes, the project aims to identify optimal configurations. The results demonstrate that increasing the number of filters significantly improves accuracy, while variations in batch size have a more nuanced impact.</p>

# Objective
<p>The primary objective of this project is to investigate how changes in CNN hyperparameters, specifically the number of filters and batch size, affect model performance on the Fashion MNIST dataset.</p>
